  value: "I believe I am being overlooked for compensation from being a victim of what Navy Federal Credit Union has done to an extrememly large number of their account holders. The following situations have occured multiple times : 1. Getting any source of available money ( large chunkes ) from my checkings or savings account to put on my credit card balance regardless of paying more than the monthly minimum payment, and having a great history doing so. That is now making my credit drop since it is a negative look, looking as if I could n\'t make the payment so the bank did. They did this will no warning what so ever and without my consent. \n2. Randomly freezing accounts with no warning and no reason as to why. \n3. Returning checks when I had more money available than the amount due for bills, resulting in a {$30.00} fee from Navy Federal. Also, making a red flag on my record due to the fact of giving the illusion that I am incapable of paying my bills. \n4. I was actually told by a representative they were going to be very helpful with any financial hardships, however they have completely made it worse for my family and I. \n5.

I was just told today that XXXX of the checks bounced back, when I had more available money in my account than the due payment. Today I also just found out the bill that got bounced back was the result of NFCU transferring money from my checkings account to my credit card balance ( example of situation no. 1 ) without my knowing or consent. Now the insurance company is billing us for double the amount of my usual due payment. Navy Federal Credit Union has put my family and I in such a deep hole that I am afraid of not being to get out of it."

I told them that I did not understand why they needed to hold the funds for an entire week if the check had cleared. I spoke to several managers and they refused to budge on this issue, although I had been a Suntrust client since XX/XX/XXXX. \nThis is not the first time I have had problems with Suntrust holding large sums of my money. Just two weeks ago I called in advance to Suntrust advising them I would be using my debit card to make a large purchase of {$14000.00} to alert them so it would go through. What ended up happening it went though on Suntrust \'s end but not the vendor \'s end so my {$14000.00} was debited from my checking account but not credited to the vendor so he could not release the merchandise but my money was gone. This happened on another occasion as well, so I am increasingly concerned about Suntrust \'s ethics and using my money for personal gain. \nI have read through other people \'s problems with Suntrust but there does n\'t seem to be much resolution on the part of CFPB.

  value: "I have a loan with Caliber Home Loans. I had a payment that was not processed due to insufficient funds in XXXX. The mortgage company processed the XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX payments after the fact and never credited my loan for XX/XX/XXXX. I was unaware of the situation and then paid my XX/XX/XXXX on time and early XXXX payment in the Mail. Still unaware. The bank returned those two payments in the mail to me un-cashed and when I called to ask why I was told that my home had a scheduled trustee sales date of XX/XX/XXXX and that they returned those tow payments because my house was selling. I have owned my home for 17 years I have never had any negative history. I have a substantial amount of equity in my home also. After many phone calls my only recourse to stop the foreclosure was to do a repayment agreement. That amount changed from originally $ XXXX to {$19.00} with no breakdown or explanation of what the monies would go toward. I was told that it would stop the proceeding and I had to give them a cashiers check for {$9400.00} up front and then {$1100.00} above my mortgage payment balances per month of {$2300.00} over the balance. I paid the {$9400.00} and never receive any proof that the foreclosure was cancelled or any account of funds and why. I immediately called numerous times and the supervisor I worked with was no longer there an any commitment he made verbally they could not honor. Now my foreclosure was on hold and they still could not tell me what the XXXX was for. My mortgage payments due for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX added up to only the {$9400.00}. I continued to call and talk to supervisors I paid the agreed amounts in XXXX on the XXXX, XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX on the XXXX of the month. When i went to make the payment in XXXX I was told that I breached the agreement and now my house was foreclosing again. Apparently there was no grace period for days in the month and it was due only on the XXXX or it was null and void. I talked numerous supervisors and representatives again and even had a copy of the XX/XX/XXXX agreement and there is no verbiage on the no grace period. A supervisor named XXXX finally apologized for his representative talking the XXXX payment and not saying anything or alerting me that the 9 days created a problem. he said he would reinstate the agreement and to wait 24 hours and call him back to make my payment which I did. Again I did not know of any problem. In XXXX 5x months early I called to make a lump sum payment to get the loan current. I was told that I owed {$7800.00} and additional fees of $ XXXX but i could dispute that amount after I paid the {$7800.00} separately and it would make the loan current and that the foreclosure would be cancelled. I did this on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative committed to me I would get a letter stating then that my loan was current and that she would guide me to dispute the separate incorrect charges. I never recieved anything and no one can help me to dispute and no one can tell me where {$24000.00} over my mortgage payment went. why I would owe still {$3500.00} in fees and why the do not owe me back the difference in over payment over aprox {$4500.00} went. and why the original amount was XXXX over what was due?? why they were foreclosing to begin with since they could have applied the XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX payments proceeded to XX/XX/XXXX which I believe is against the law or the XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payments that they returned to me. I never had any phone conversations with them ever end they were mailing to the home address and not my XXXX so i was completely uniformed. I have no hardship. I want my credit repaid I want the XXXX paid back to me above the mortgage due, i want my {$4500.00} overage paid back and all fees reversed and proof that I am current and that the foreclosure is cancelled."
  value: "I have been banking with TD Bank for approximately two years. I knew from the beginning that they were nothing but a bunch of crooks. They expect their customers to keep a specific balance in their checking account. I talked with the manager at the TD bank in XXXX about the {$15.00} service charge based on the balance. He agreed that it was not appropriate and refunded my money. It is my money and not this bunch of crooks. \nThey took {$15.00} out about two months ago and I complained. They refunded the money. Now they have done it again and overdrew my account. CROOKS. I will change banks just as soon as my SS check is deposited. I hate the legal crooks that banks are. They provide no services."

At first, they refused and indicated that they did not have to send it writing. I said that I have no knowledge of any debts being owed that I would have to verify -- the woman began speaking over me and said that this was a mediation. I advised her that I was an attorney and that this was NOT a mediation and she was not following proper procedure to collect a debt. At which point she hung up. She then called back a few minutes later and wanted my address. I said, if you have debt that I owe you have my information and address. She then said she would see me in court again and hung up. I have no problem paying money that is owed. However, I have been up to date on all of my bills for a number of years and I have no knowledge of any debts being owed. It is also improper to have not written communication about a debt and instead a violent phone call demanding information. This seems to be violation of the FDCA."

  value: "I just spoke to \" XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX PA XXXX Phone ( XXXX ) XXXX \'\' after first XXXX XXXX XXXX itself at the number online. This phone number is not XXXX XXXX XXXX. See attached .pdf. This has been since at least XXXX XXXX. So, they provided no explanation as to why this happened to get on page XXXX of my credit file dated XXXX XXXX XXXX, Confirmation # XXXX. While I am pointing out how that is a problem from a reinvestigation perspective, I also want to not that I asked about another \" ( XXXX ) XXXX \'\' toll-free number at this address is not a number she recognized, despite both being attributed to this same address. Naturally, curious about that, called that number as well. All this is very disturbing considering that the initian Equifax disputes I submitted to them directly and also through the CFPB about XXXX XXXX XXXX, were supposedly invesrigated and reinvestigated. This one cites \" original \'\' documents submitted by XXXX to Equifax. Low and behold the word \" original \'\' is not exactly correct then. Instead, fascsimile or manufactured copies seem to have been submitted. Based on the replies to the various replies received by all the companies and attached to those CFPB complaints, I see that the originals appear to have been \" doctored \'\' between XXXX and XXXX. I want to see the \" orginals \'\' in thier original form submitted to Equifax and CFPB rather than something else. After all, we are bound by those original documents equally. I know that the guarantor affirmed in XXXX that all was identical to the ones approves by them, such that no discrepancy warranted anything other than approval. Yet, \" Item As of Date Reported XXXX/XXXX/XXXX \'\' said the date of the last payment was \" XXXX \'\' which is false. Worse still, the late of the last delinquency was \" XXXX \'\' and in between those dates all three IBR forms were submitted on time and approved by XXXX of XXXX servicers ; XXXX of which is the guarantor of this very loan. Another XXXX XXXX XXXX account appears below that which was in good standing and went to that said guarantor. So both are tied to XXXX XXXX XXXX. The first page of the credit report where a XXXX disputed credit card was furnished during the XXXX year in its entirety and said that only Equifax still reports it per their letter XXXX XXXX XXXX but in a subsequent letter says different. Todat they say they never furnished the XXXX reporting at all. So this points directly to the XXXX servicer posing as XXXX XXXX XXXX itself orchestrating all this misinformation from their own zip code. By XXXX \" rubber stamping \'\' that investigation to resukt in this erroneous piece of paper printed on both sides makes me want Equifax to remove all these accounts and not waste any more time investigating. If the addresses and phone numbers are fraudulent, how can that even begin to address my legitimate complaints? This is a farce. No proper investigation was done to result in this report today. Recap : 1. Credit card is time-barred from reporting per FRCA. Remove it NOW! 2. The student loan is not contact that is accurate. Trickery is never a good thing. XXXX told me they are not reporting any longer and no payments were made to any account in XXXX, regardless of what XXXX XXXX XXXX account is furnishing payment history. 3. The phone numbers do n\'t matchbthe business they are listed with. What a mess!!!!! Get it together, Equifax!"

  value: "Beginning XX/XX/XXXX, PNC erroneously purchased multiple forced placed insurance policies, which have since been acknowledged by PNC as errors in a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. The diversion of funds for insurance caused a cascade effect of shortfalls and penalties as a result of the original errors. PNC has not yet fully refunded these amounts or accounted for the incorrect accounting that ensued. \n\nI claim ; 1. As agreed in a PNC letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, PNC credited principal for {$810.00} but has since reversed that transaction without explanation and has failed to correct this after being informed. \n2. The methodology of issuing dollar for dollar refunds many years later is mathematically flawed, resulting in an overstatement of principal balance and excessive interest charges to the borrower over the life of loan. \n3. The accounting reports provided by PNC are obtuse, confusing and poorly documented to the point of being impossible to independently audit. The outstanding balance does not agree with a simplified amortization that eliminates all the superfluous transactions. \n4. Since XX/XX/XXXX, borrower has fully complied with the mortgage agreement to the extent possible given the errors and misinformation by PNC and that a recomputation of payments since that time, eliminating all erroneous information, applying mortgage payments solely to principal and interest, shows that the outstanding balance of the loan is overstated by {$2600.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX. \n5. PNC has breeched our contract by incorrect application of funds as stated in paragraph 2 of the Mortgage Agreement and failing or refusing to correct these errors that have been brought to their attention in five different RSPA Qualified Written Requests since XX/XX/XXXX. \n6. Borrower has incurred substantial costs and time to discover and bring these errors to the attention of PNC and is entitled to compensation as allowed by RSPA regulations. \n\nAs a starting point, as of XX/XX/XXXX the outstanding balance of the loan is stated by PNC to be {$150000.00} and I agree with that amount. I claim that since that date, there are no valid cause for funds to be applied to anything but interest and principal and that a simple reconstruction of the monthly payment transactions since that date ( to principal and interest ) is all that is necessary to establish the correct outstanding balance. ( See attached spreadsheet ) As of XX/XX/XXXX the PNC stated balance is {$10000.00}, however a simple amortization of transactions since XX/XX/XXXX with all PNC errors and subsequent corrections eliminated, produces an outstanding balance of {$8000.00} ; an overstatement of outstanding balance by PNC of {$2600.00}. \n\nThe exact cause of this discrepancy is impossible to pinpoint, due to the numerous undocumented transactions in the PNC loan accounting. However, the concept of refunding fees at a later date, after subsequent principal/interest calculations have occurred, is a fundamentally flawed accounting method that results in the overstatement of outstanding balance, inflating all subsequent interest calculations. Although seemingly small, the miscalculations are compounded and passed along to each subsequent mortgage payment, resulting in significant interest overpayments by the borrower throughout the life of the loan. \n\nI request PNC to state any and all valid charges that have occurred since XX/XX/XXXX which are not a consequence of errors by PNC and if there are none, as I maintain, then PNC should accept my amortization calculations and reduce the outstanding balance by an amount of {$2600.00}. I also request compensation for time and costs I have incurred, by an amount to be determined."

  value: "Dear CFPB, This letter is a complaint against USAA. In this complaint, you will see that I was mislead by advertising that failed to clearly expose fees and that I was misinformed by multiple USAA representatives on the phone. Additionally, I was avoided by USAA customer service on multiple occasions and a Senior Representative lied to me. My complaint explains how I was charged {$290.00} in fees that USAA refused to refund when unsuccessfully attempted to resolve my complaint with USAA \'s customer service. \n\nMy complaint starts when I received an advertisement in the mail regarding a USAA credit card with no interest until XX/XX/2018. At the time, I needed cash to cover a debt and the card advertised no fees on convenience. To verify that I had not missed anything in the letter, I called USAA and spoke with a representative who stated that there were no fees on the USAA credit card convenience checks that I received an advertisement for. I had an additional question about a week later and posed the same question to another representative who verified that there would not be any fees and this representative offered to send me additional convenience checks. Upon receiving the convince checks that arrived shortly after I received the card, I wrote XXXX checks and, to my dismay, I found that my account had been charged {$290.00} in additional fees due to the checks. After seeing the fees, I called USAA and spoke with XXXX people, the last of whom stated that she was a Senior Resolution Specialist. The Senior Resolution Specialist stated that a manager would look into the issue and would pull the voice recordings of my phone conversations as part of his or her analysis ; she stated that I would be called back in two to three business days. A week later, I had not received a phone call from USAA, so I called USAA again. This time, I spoke with another Senor Resolution Specialist named XXXX who informed me that there was no record of my issue being escalated to a manager and that no one had done any analysis nor was there any inclination of calling me back. XXXX informed me that a manager would call me. After my conversation with XXXX, the Senior Resolution Specialist, a manger named XXXX called me and left a voicemail. I called XXXX back XXXX times and left him multiple voicemails ; XXXX called me back more than a week after leaving my first voicemail. XXXX stated that my {$290.00} in fees would not be refunded even though I had been misinformed by XXXX USAA representatives ; he reasoned that, somewhere in the letter I received, the fees were explained. I asked XXXX about the voice recordings and what review he had done of my case because I had been informed that my case would be reviewed thoroughly including a review of the recorded phone calls ; XXXX stated that USAA was not going to review my case any further and that no assessment of my previous conversations would be made. \n\nAs can be seen above, I have been unjustly charged {$290.00} in fees that I was told I would not be charged and USAA has refused to take responsibility for misinforming me. I have spent multiple hours explaining my case to USAA and my efforts appear to have been in vain which is how come I am sending this letter to you as a last resort. \n\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX"

  value: "I \'ve been a member of the eBay and PayPal community since 2000. I only sell things intermittently but have run into serious and costly problems only recently. I listed several XXXX XXXX XXXX collector item statues on eBay for sale in their online auctions, all used with descriptive pictures. Every one of them sold and as eBay forces you to use PayPal for all of your transactions as a seller, I also had to use this service to transfer money. eBay and PayPal charge a 15 % fee between them, raking in lots of money. In my auctions, I listed that I do not accept returns or refunds and all items are as is. I also stated the requirements of my auctions, XXXX Mail XXXX shipping, damage insurance and signature delivery, and of course, no international sales. After receiving these items sent by insured mail, I began to receive notices of \'not delivered \' or that a buyer is complaining due to \'item not being as described \'. I accepted XXXX items as a return due to damage and filed insurance claims, not because I wanted to but because both eBay and PayPal literally forced me to. PayPal withheld funds from my balance and even forced me to take refunds in situations I found were to be fraudulent. Despite proving that I was being defrauded and even their customer service agreeing with me and claiming \'that buyer has done it to many others \', they ruled in favor of the buyer and forced me to accept refunds on these items. As if that was n\'t bad enough, they send messages to the buyer telling them to keep the items. Now I \'m out for the loss they take from my paypal balance, or even hitting my bank account, and the collectible that I was forced to take back is still in the hands of the buyer that defrauded me. Not to mention, the fees totaling a minimum of 15 % of the selling price, I still have to pay. This is blatant fraud, but their response is to hide behind their unconscionable user agreement I never signed. Simply because I logged into their website, I supposedly agreed to their terms. I did n\'t agree to be defrauded, or to lose my things and have to give a refunds, plus pay fees. I look online and see various websites that are laden with comments that eBay and PayPal find in favor of the buyer in nearly every single issue. All a buyer has to do is to claim they did n\'t receive something at all ( despite their signature on the package from USPS ), or that the item they purchased was n\'t received \'as described \' and they automatically issue a refund before any other notification is given to the seller. No matter what evidence is presented, they issue a refund, then they tell the buyer to keep the item! I see what the CFPB does with debt collection companies, this is no different. They are acting as a third party and enabling fraud with disregard for the law. They must be stopped! I see various state lawsuits for XXXX violations and even fraud, but this belongs to the CFPB!

I started to inquire the credit reporting agencies why my credit was bad. My issue is why would SunTrust Bank turned down my credit, and then turn around, a month later and ask for a late auto payment installment? SunTrust Bank, nor any other bank that turned down my credit, never ever notified me that my credit had been approved after all. It does not make sense. I state that I have no credit with SunTrust Bank because they denied my credit on XXXX, 2015."
  value: "My ex-boyfriend has his friend who XXXX take back my old BMW and traded it for a brand new {$47000.00} BMW. The dealership FORGED MY SIGNATURE on the contract, therefor I do n\'t even have a copy of whatever contract they signed. They switched everything over at the dealership and he drove the car around for two months without me even knowing he had done this. He did n\'t even pay for the car, and then it got repossessed and I get an outstanding balance bill. XXXX credit collectors have gotten this account and then dropped the case once they reviewed the contract. I have been disputing this with all XXXX credit reporting agencies but BMW always claims the account is mine. How is this so when my signature was forged and this vehicle was bought without my permission in MY name. I currently have a loan open site BMW Financial services which also has my signature on it. I \'ve repeatedly asked BMW to review the contract so they can see the difference in the signatures but I never get a response. Please help."
  value: "My wife and I bought our home in XX/XX/XXXX. Our lender was XXXX XXXX XXXX at that time. Last year they were bought out by Freedom Mortgage, and ever since then we have had nothing but hardships and trouble. First, they kept mailing me letters and calling me non stop about refinancing, telling me they can get us a better interest rate and lower monthly payment. So we decided to try it out finally. My last job put me in a financial rut that I \'ve been trying to get out of, so we planned on doing a cash out refi to pay off all our debt so we only had our mortgage to worry about monthly. Well after being strung along for months assuring us the refi will work no problem, all of a sudden the \" ratios would n\'t work \'\'. We needed to pay down some of our debt to make the ratios work. We had no money to pay down debt, so they told us to borrow from family and we could just pay them back with cash from our equity after the refi goes through. So I borrowed $ XXXX from my parents. A few weeks later, \" oh the ratios still wont work \'\'. They said that my wife needs to show more income. She is a commission based hair stylist, so she is a XXXX self employed, so Freedom Mortgage said she needs to do her taxes a certain way so that it shows she made at least $ XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. So since she used no write offs, when we filed the taxes she now owes over $ XXXX to the IRS on top of what she already owes from XX/XX/XXXX, and Freedom Mortgage said well you can just pull that $ XXXX from your cash out refi and pay it off in full ... \nGuess what? .... \" Ratios still wont work, your debt is still too high \'\'. I finally started looking into our credit reports on my own to see what XXXX was happening. I downloaded the credit karma app on my phone and I found that somehow, mysteriously, a XXXX home loan was sitting on my credit. My wife \'s credit only showed $ XXXX to Freedom Mortgage, when my personal credit report showed $ XXXX with XXXX XXXX, and another loan for $ XXXX with Freedom Mortgage. \nIts no wonder our refi fell apart, because they never paid and closed my first mortgage account and nobody could see that on my credit score??? But I was able to find it on my own? This is a perfect example of Predatory Lending Practices. Because of this, my wife and I are now over $ XXXX more in debt to the IRS and paying back family. \nOn top of this, a month ago my mortgage payment increased by {$450.00} because our impound account came up negative due to shortage in impound account payments. Our mortgage payment has been the same since we bought the house in XX/XX/XXXX, NOW, Freedom mortgage is saying that payment has been wrong all along and we really should have been paying a higher mortgage payment. So why now after almost 3 years in this house do my payments not cover my taxes??? \nThis is not legal and I believe that Freedom Mortgage should be paying that negative balance due to their own error in our loan. Their company are the ones who ran my loan, who bought my loan from the previous lender, and send me bills for a certain dollar amount. I pay the amount we signed for when we closed escrow. I am in a 30 year fixed conventional loan, my payment should not be going up {$450.00} because they are incompetent. I spoke to the XXXX County Accessors office and they told me my property tax has not changed at all other than the standard 2 % just like everyone else. I am being taken advantage of by Freedom Mortgage. They do n\'t send email confirmations when a payment is made, they do n\'t provide any documentation or paper trails for anything. They can not raise my fixed payment almost {$500.00}."
  value: "On XXXX XXXX, 2016 I disputed XXXX XXXX and requested validation of the account via certified mail ( XXXX ). \nOn XXXX XXXX, 2016, I received a letter stating XXXX XXXX could not locate my file and I needed to provide the full account number and social security number. \nClearly, if XXXX XXXX is reporting this information the the credit bureaus, they should be able to validate the account. I have enclosed a copy of the signed letter with my full name along with my address. It has been over 30 days and XXXX XXXX still has not validated this account."
  value: "On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I purchased a XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$12000.00}. I was told that I had to put {$2000.00} down and then only pay a balance of {$10000.00}. I was never told that there would be interest. I was told the monthly payments would be {$330.00} per month. I signed many documents but I was not provided with a copy of any of the documents. I then received a payment booklet in the mail from Credit Acceptance XXXX and discovered that there were 60 monthly coupons for {$380.00} each ( {$22000.00} ). That totaled {$24000.00} ( coupons plus my {$2000.00} down payment ) for a XXXX year old vehicle with XXXX miles on it. The car has many mechanical problems. I have no idea what interest rate that I am being charged. I never agreed to pay back a total of {$22000.00}. I was never provided with a copy of the Bill of Sale or Retail Instalment Obligation. I am a XXXX XXXX earning {$950.00} net biweekly living in a rent stabilized apartment. I would have never qualified for such a loan if my true income was used. I believe the lender \'s sales representative committed fraud on my application. I would have rather been denied the loan had I known I would have been saddled with interest, etc. I also learned that I financed an extended warranty as well."
  value: "Over the course of the summer, I applied for an installment loan with Avant at a 12 % interest rate. I selected a loan amount of {$11000.00} in which I thought it would be a 12 % interest rate for 36 months. On the website, the interest rate was and is hidden. Also, it is hard to tell how much you owe as well. Upon performing further research, I have learned that I am paying a 4 year loan at 34 %. I called Avant and complained about my rate and was advised I can apply again within 6 months. I waited 6 months and they said that you will actually have to wait 12 months to refinance. I have paid XXXX payments with a total amount of {$3400.00} with only paying down {$830.00} of the principal. I have a XXXX credit score and had recently applied for a pre-approval for a home mortgage, but I was denied the amount requested due to this high paying loan as it was a concern for my lender. I have performed research and have found out that this is predatory lending and I would like present my case and my loan application to be reviewed. I never applied for a 34 % Loan as this type of loan will keep individuals in eternal debt."

  value: "This letter is to follow up on our recent contact with you earlier this month. As we explained, we have been the victims of identity theft. It recently came to our attention that our names, home and business addresses, dates of birth and social security numbers have been used to open savings and checking accounts and to obtain pre-paid debit cards. \n\nSpecifically, in 2016 our personal information was used to open a checking account at Capital One 360. Of note, this occurred without Capital One performing a credit check with any of the XXXX credit reporting agencies, and fraudulent email addresses and phone numbers were provided and not checked for validity. We believe these are egregious practices. We have spoken with Capital One, who has reportedly closed the account. \n\nWe are informing you of this so that any further activity using our names and numbers without our knowledge or consent should be considered part of that identity breach. Further, we have requested that our financial institutions inform us of any activity using our names and other identifying information prior to completing any fund transfers, opening new accounts or any other financial activities. \n\nWe are reaching out to you with this letter on advice of our legal counsel and the Oregon Attorney General \'s office, and as one of several law enforcement-recommended actions. We have already notified the XXXX credit reporting agencies and our other financial institutions. We have filed official reports with our local law enforcement agencies and the Federal Trade Commission. \n\nOur goal is to be proactive in protecting ourselves, as well as to assist our financial institutions, law enforcement and legislators to address an apparent gap in this vulnerable system that needs immediate repair. We would like you to work with us to help stop this fraudulent activity. For instance, we believe that all banking institutions should be required to perform and document a formal credit check, as a matter of legal record, in order to open a new account of any kind and to double check the validity of email and phone information provided. \n\nThe Oregon Attorney General \'s office has advised us to be in constant contact with our financial institutions as we do our part to monitor this situation closely. Needless to say, the more cooperation there is between stakeholders, the more likely criminal behavior such as this can be dealt with effectively toward a just resolution. We have requested that our accounts have a notation documenting this identity breach. We have changed our passwords, added an additional security \" code word \'\' and initiated Voice Print identification to our accounts. \n\nAny further suggestions for additional actions we can take toward protecting ourselves would be appreciated. \n\nThank you so much for your good work."
  value: "This loan went into default status off 5 years ago after I fell behind in payments. I attempted to reach out through their XXXXXXXXXXXX email and never got anything back. Eventually the loan was charged off but remained on my credit. In an attempt to repair my credit, I submitted several dispute claims to validate the loan and received nothing in return. Currently, my wife and I are trying to close on a new home loan, but conventional loans prohibit any disputes listed on your file. I tried to go through XXXX to have the verbiage removed to satisfy the requirement, but was told by them that we have to get Prospers approval. We called Prosper and was told that they will not approve the removal of the dispute verbiage. Digging deeper, we were told by Prosper that the charged off loan is no longer in their possession, but in the hands of a third party. It is this 3rd party that is handling my disputes and reporting to the credit agencies. I have attempted on several occasions to work with Prosper to have the dispute removed, but am meet with unanswered emails and CSRs with limited information to give. When asking to discuss with a manager, no manager is available."
  value: "Today I checked my credit report, and there was an unknown medical collection from FBCS Inc, account number XXXX. I have never heard of this company, I have never received any information pertaining to the bill or collection in question. I have no idea what it is from, or where it came from. My credit report says that this is a medical collection that was assigned on XXXX. FBCS, Inc. had plenty of time to send me a \" debt validation notice \'\' prior to inserting this onto my credit report, but has failed to do so. \n\nFBCS lists the original creditor as XXXX. I have never opened an account with XXXX, nor have I ever received a bill from them. Nor did I ever receive any communication from FBCS. INC. My address is listed on my credit report yet they never sent me a \" debt validation notice \'\' prior to reporting these accounts to the CRA \'s like they are required to by law. FBCS XXXX failure to send the Debt Validation Notices to me prevented me from exercising my legal right to request debt validation of the alleged debt at the outset. Since I have never received one they are in violation of Section 809 ( a ) the FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( a ). \n\nUnder HIPAA privacy laws FBCS. INC. should not have any of my personal medical information, unless they have a \" written \'\' agreement with their \" client \'\' that grants them the authority to collect on this alleged debt, or proof of acquisition by purchase or assignment, and authorization under subtitle D of the XXXX, SEC. XXXX. They also have to provide an agreement that bears the signature of the alleged debtor wherein he or she agreed to pay the creditor and as this is a medical account a copy of any HIPAA authorization. \n\nI am not pleased with the federal bond and collection, they have failed to attempt an explanation of my \" supposed debt. \'\' I would like this removed immediately from my credit report, and for the company to never contact me. This practice of not contacting and ruining someone \'s credit is unjust."
  value: "Today I received a prescreened offer from Capital One for a credit card. ( Reservation # XXXX Access Code XXXX ). This offer was very confusing to me as I am 1 ) XXXX ) 2 ) low income 3 ) have a low credit score and am not eligible for credit cards. I contacted the opt out phone number given by Capital and could not complete the process because the automated system inappropriately asked for my social security number and date of birth. This complaint is to have you stop Capital or any other bank from making offers to people who are clearly not eligible and to stop the credit card opt out company from asking for inappropriate information."
  value: "XXXX Hospital did not file my insurance correctly which caused my insurance not to pay the full amount of the bill which now has been added to my credit and has damaged my credit. I explained to the collection agency that i am XXXX and i am on XXXX and XXXX which pays 100 percent of all medical bills and the hospital would need to file the proper insurance to get the proper payments and they refuse. I am on a limited income and can not afford to pay my medical bills which is why i am approved for both insurances. They will not fix their error which is continuing to damage my credit severally."
  value: "Years ago I had someone purchase a car with a cashier \'s check. Car was gone and check deposited into my account at XXXX XXXX Credit Union. Few days later, money was withdrawn to purchase another car but found out later that the cashier \'s check was canceled. Could not find the people so the car and the money were gone. I had lost my job and was unable to pay the debt to the credit union. They took it to small claims court and I had filed bankruptcy due to losing employment and divorce. Debt to the credit union has been discharged. I ended up moving to another state and tried to open a local bank account, but found that the credit union has me listed with Early Warning Services as a fraud user. I have several emails with the credit union explaining if I pay the debt they can release my name from the fraud list. This violates the terms of bankruptcy code as well as Fair Credit Reporting Act. I just would like my name off the list in order to open an account."
